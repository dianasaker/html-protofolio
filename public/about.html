<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Diana Saker, and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from The Open University. 
  I have 2.5 years of experience working as a Software Developer Intern at Intel, 
  where I designed and developed new features for high-scale projects using Python.
  My role involved troubleshooting and testing core product software and databases,
  as well as implementing optimizations for system efficiency and reliability. 
  I collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions.

<p>
  Before my internship, I worked as an Electrical Validation Engineer student at Intel, 
  where I conducted validation, debugging, and tuning of high-performance client CPUs. 
  Additionally, I have experience as an instructor at the Madaatech science museum
  and A. Levinsky Consulting and Management, teaching programming using Scratch to young students aged 8-10.
</p>

<p>
  I have a strong educational background, having completed a B.Sc. in Computer Science with a GPA of 82
  from The Open University. 
  My final project involved developing the backend of a web application for dog owners using Python, 
  FastAPI, and MongoDB. The application allows dog owners to create accounts, 
  find nearby dog walkers, and includes a vaccination table for dogs. 
  I collaborated with a team to integrate the frontend built with React and CSS.

<p>
  Currently, I am learning the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy, 
  where I am gaining knowledge in technologies and programming languages 
  such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, React, Redux, Express.js, and Git. 
  This comprehensive course covers both frontend and backend development, 
  allowing me to build full-stack web applications.

<p>
  I am fluent in English, Hebrew, and Arabic, and 
  I have strong skills in Python, PyCharm, Linux, Git, JavaScript, Java, MongoDB, and FastAPI.
  I am passionate about software development and always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

<p>
  In addition to my technical skills, I have a passion for the arts. 
  I have been drawing realistic portraits since I was young, and my artistic abilities have always been 
  a significant part of my life. 
  Moreover, I have been playing volleyball in a league since 2010, 
  which has taught me the value of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.
